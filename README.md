# PARSER-CHECKER-DIRECTORY
IF YOU WANT TO PARSE-CHECK DIRECTORIES, THEN THIS IS THE IDEAL OPTION

How it works? You download git clone https://github.com/Volodya070/PARSER-CHEKER-DIRECTORY.git,
cd PARSER-CHEKER-DIRECTORY, then open the sitepars file in which you need to insert your sites, 
the format is one site per line.Save changes and run
python3 pars.py sitepars.txt /YOUR DIRECTORY TO PARSE. Parsing is running, 
everything successful is saved in sitesthatyouspars.txt
BEFORE THIS I RECOMMEND:
LINUX: sudo apt update, sudo apt upgrade
TERMUX: pkg update, pkg upgrade

Internet will help you with other errors :)
